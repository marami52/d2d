# Dual Time Dynamic Model in Cedit Risk

Dual Time Dynamic (DtD) model presented by Breeden (2007) decomposes vintage level data to months-on-books (maturation), 
calendar date (exogenous) and vintage (quality). In this article, I demonstrate how we can use APC package in R to apply DtD models in credit risk management and stress testing.

Sample data is also provided in this repo.
